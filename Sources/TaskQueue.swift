/**
 A `TaskQueue` is a FIFO queue where _tasks_ can be enqueued for execution. The
 tasks will be executed in order up to `maxConcurrentTasks` concurrently. The start
 of a task will be delayed up until the current number of running tasks is below
 the allowed maximum number of concurrent tasks.

 When a task completes it will be automatically dequeued and its completion handler
 will be called.

 The allowed maximum number of concurrent tasks can be changed while tasks are
 executing.
`
 A _task_ is simply a non-throwing asynchronous function with a single parameter
 `completion` which is a function type. The completion function has a single parameter
 which desginates the result type of the task. On completion, the task MUST call
 the completion handler passing the result. Usually, the result type is a discriminated
 union (aka Enum) which contains either a value or an error.
